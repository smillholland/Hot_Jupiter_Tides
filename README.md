# Tidal Dissipation in Hot Jupiter Host Stars
This repository contains supplementary material to the paper Millholland, S., MacLeod, M., & Xiao, F. 2025, ApJ, in press, Empirical Constraints on Tidal Dissipation in Exoplanet Host Stars. The code found here reproduces some of the figures in the paper. 

The Jupyter notebook entitled "HJ_Population_Toy_Model.ipynb" contains a demonstration of a toy model of simulated hot Jupiter populations that explores population-level features of tidal decay. This reproduces Section 2, Figure 2. 

The Jupyter notebook entitled "PDE_Solution.ipynb" contains an example of the numerical PDE solution to the continuity equation (equation 11). It reproduces Section 3, Figure 4.
